- A description of the issue.
- Steps describing how the issue can be reproduced, ideally in the ExoPlayer demo app.
- If the issue only reproduces with certain content, a link to some content that we can use to reproduce. If you have a link but don't wish to post it publicly, please submit the issue, then email the link or content to dev.exoplayer@gmail.com including the issue number in the subject line.
- The version of ExoPlayer being used.
- The device(s) and version(s) of Android on which the issue can be reproduced, and how easily it reproduces. Does it happen every time, or only occasionally? If possible, please test on multiple devices and Android versions. If the issue does not reproduce on some combinations, that’s useful information!
- A full bug report taken from the device just after the issue occurs, attached as a file. A bug report can be captured from the command line using "adb bugreport". Note that the output from "adb logcat" or a log snippet is not sufficient.
- Anything else you think might be relevant!
