Please make sure to search for an existing issue before filing a new one, including issues that are
closed. If you wish to go ahead and open a new issue, please make sure to include all of the
following, unless you're certain that they're not required for the particular issue being reported.

- [] A description of the issue.
- [] Steps describing how the issue can be reproduced, ideally in the ExoPlayer demo app.
- [] If the issue only reproduces with certain content, a link to some content that we can use to
     reproduce. If you have a link but don't wish to post it publicly, please submit the issue, then
     email the link or content to `dev.exoplayer@gmail.com` including the issue number in the
     subject line.
- [] The version of ExoPlayer being used.
- [] The device(s) and version(s) of Android on which the issue can be reproduced, and how easily it
     reproduces. Does it happen every time, or only occassionally? If possible, please test on
     multiple devices and Android versions. If the issue does not reproduce on some combinations,
     that’s useful information!
- [] A full bug report taken from the device just after the issue occurs, attached as a file. A bug
     report can be captured from the command line using "adb bugreport". Note that the output from
     "adb logcat" or a log snippet (in particular a snippet that only contains a stack trace) is not
     sufficient.
- [] Anything else you think might be relevant!

Thanks!
