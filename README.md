# ExoPlayer <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/google/ExoPlayer.svg?label=latest"/> #

ExoPlayer is an application level media player for Android. It provides an
alternative to Android’s MediaPlayer API for playing audio and video both
locally and over the Internet. ExoPlayer supports features not currently
supported by Android’s MediaPlayer API, including DASH and SmoothStreaming
adaptive playbacks. Unlike the MediaPlayer API, ExoPlayer is easy to customize
and extend, and can be updated through Play Store application updates.

## Using ExoPlayer ##

ExoPlayer modules can be obtained from [the Google Maven repository][]. It's
also possible to clone the repository and depend on the modules locally.

### From the Google Maven repository

#### 1. Add ExoPlayer module dependencies ####

The easiest way to get started using ExoPlayer is to add it as a gradle
dependency in the `build.gradle` file of your app module. The following will add
a dependency to the full library:

```gradle
implementation 'com.google.android.exoplayer:exoplayer:2.X.X'
```

where `2.X.X` is your preferred version.

Note: old versions of ExoPlayer are available via JCenter. To use them, you need
to add `jcenter()` to your project's root build.gradle `repositories` block.

As an alternative to the full library, you can depend on only the library
modules that you actually need. For example the following will add dependencies
on the Core, DASH and UI library modules, as might be required for an app that
plays DASH content:

```gradle
implementation 'com.google.android.exoplayer:exoplayer-core:2.X.X'
implementation 'com.google.android.exoplayer:exoplayer-dash:2.X.X'
implementation 'com.google.android.exoplayer:exoplayer-ui:2.X.X'
```

The available library modules are listed below. Adding a dependency to the full
library is equivalent to adding dependencies on all of the library modules
individually.

* `exoplayer-core`: Core functionality (required).
* `exoplayer-dash`: Support for DASH content.
* `exoplayer-hls`: Support for HLS content.
* `exoplayer-smoothstreaming`: Support for SmoothStreaming content.
* `exoplayer-ui`: UI components and resources for use with ExoPlayer.

In addition to library modules, ExoPlayer has extension modules that depend on
external libraries to provide additional functionality. Some extensions are
available from the Maven repository, whereas others must be built manually.
Browse the [extensions directory][] and their individual READMEs for details.

More information on the library and extension modules that are available can be
found on the [Google Maven ExoPlayer page][].

[extensions directory]: https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/tree/release-v2/extensions/
[the Google Maven repository]: https://developer.android.com/studio/build/dependencies#google-maven
[Google Maven ExoPlayer page]: https://maven.google.com/web/index.html#com.google.android.exoplayer

#### 2. Turn on Java 8 support ####

If not enabled already, you also need to turn on Java 8 support in all
`build.gradle` files depending on ExoPlayer, by adding the following to the
`android` section:

```gradle
compileOptions {
  targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
}
```

### Locally ###

Cloning the repository and depending on the modules locally is required when
using some ExoPlayer extension modules. It's also a suitable approach if you
want to make local changes to ExoPlayer, or if you want to use a development
branch.

First, clone the repository into a local directory and checkout the desired
branch:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer.git
cd ExoPlayer
git checkout release-v2
```

Next, add the following to your project's `settings.gradle` file, replacing
`/absolute/path/to/exoplayer` with the absolute path to your local copy:

```gradle
gradle.ext.exoplayerRoot = '/absolute/path/to/exoplayer'
gradle.ext.exoplayerModulePrefix = 'exoplayer-'
apply from: new File(gradle.ext.exoplayerRoot, 'core_settings.gradle')
```

You should now see the ExoPlayer modules appear as part of your project. You can
depend on them as you would on any other local module, for example:

```gradle
implementation project(':exoplayer-library-core')
implementation project(':exoplayer-library-dash')
implementation project(':exoplayer-library-ui')
```

## Developing ExoPlayer ##

#### Project branches ####

* Development work happens on the `dev-v2` branch. Pull requests should
  normally be made to this branch.
* The `release-v2` branch holds the most recent release.

#### Using Android Studio ####

To develop ExoPlayer using Android Studio, simply open the ExoPlayer project in
the root directory of the repository.
