# ExoPlayer IMA extension #

## Description ##

The IMA extension is a [MediaSource][] implementation wrapping the
[Interactive Media Ads SDK for Android][IMA]. You can use it to insert ads
alongside content.

[MediaSource]: https://google.github.io/ExoPlayer/doc/reference/index.html?com/google/android/exoplayer2/source/MediaSource.html

## Getting the extension ##

The easiest way to use the extension is to add it as a gradle dependency:

```gradle
compile 'com.google.android.exoplayer:extension-ima:rX.X.X'
```

where `rX.X.X` is the version, which must match the version of the ExoPlayer
library being used.

Alternatively, you can clone the ExoPlayer repository and depend on the module
locally. Instructions for doing this can be found in ExoPlayer's
[top level README][].

## Using the extension ##

To play ads alongside a single-window content `MediaSource`, prepare the player
with an `ImaAdsMediaSource` constructed using an `ImaAdsLoader`, the content
`MediaSource` and an overlay `ViewGroup` on top of the player. Pass an ad tag
URI from your ad campaign when creating the `ImaAdsLoader`. The IMA
documentation includes some [sample ad tags][] for testing.

Resuming the player after entering the background requires some special handling
when playing ads. The player and its media source are released on entering the
background, and are recreated when the player returns to the foreground. When
playing ads it is necessary to persist ad playback state while in the background
by keeping a reference to the `ImaAdsLoader`. Reuse it when resuming playback of
the same content/ads by passing it in when constructing the new
`ImaAdsMediaSource`. It is also important to persist the player position when
entering the background by storing the value of `player.getContentPosition()`.
On returning to the foreground, seek to that position before preparing the new
player instance. Finally, it is important to call `ImaAdsLoader.release()` when
playback of the content/ads has finished and will not be resumed.

You can try the IMA extension in the ExoPlayer demo app. To do this you must
select and build one of the `withExtensions` build variants of the demo app in
Android Studio. You can find IMA test content in the "IMA sample ad tags"
section of the app. The demo app's `PlayerActivity` also shows how to persist
the `ImaAdsLoader` instance and the player position when backgrounded during ad
playback.
