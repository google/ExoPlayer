    ([#2643](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/2643)). Information on
    using these components to download progressive formats can be found
    [here](https://medium.com/google-exoplayer/downloading-streams-6d259eec7f95).
    To see how to download DASH, HLS and SmoothStreaming media, take a look at
    the app.
  * Updated main demo app to support downloading DASH, HLS, SmoothStreaming and
    progressive media.
* MediaSources:

    deprecated `DynamicConcatenatingMediaSource`.
  * Allow clipping of child media sources where the period and window have a
    non-zero offset with `ClippingMediaSource`.
  * Allow adding and removing `MediaSourceEventListener`s to MediaSources after
    they have been created. Listening to events is now supported for all
    media sources including composite sources.
  * Added callbacks to `MediaSourceEventListener` to get notified when media
    periods are created, released and being read from.
  * Support live stream clipping with `ClippingMediaSource`.
  * Allow setting tags for all media sources in their factories. The tag of the
    current window can be retrieved with `Player.getCurrentTag`.
* UI components:
  * Add support for displaying error messages and a buffering spinner in
    `PlayerView`.
  * Add support for listening to `AspectRatioFrameLayout`'s aspect ratio update
    ([#3736](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3736)).
  * Add `PlayerNotificationManager` for displaying notifications reflecting the
    player state.
  * Add `TrackSelectionView` for selecting tracks with `DefaultTrackSelector`.
  * Add `TrackNameProvider` for converting track `Format`s to textual
    descriptions, and `DefaultTrackNameProvider` as a default implementation.
* Track selection:

      ([#3769](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3769)).
  * Factor out `AudioTrack` position tracking from `DefaultAudioSink`.
  * Fix an issue where the playback position would pause just after playback
    begins, and poll the audio timestamp less frequently once it starts
    advancing ([#3841](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3841)).
  * Add an option to skip silent audio in `PlaybackParameters`
    ([#2635](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/2635)).
  * Fix an issue where playback of TrueHD streams would get stuck after seeking
    due to not finding a syncframe
    ([#3845](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3845)).
  * Fix an issue with eac3-joc playback where a codec would fail to configure
    ([#4165](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/4165)).
  * Handle non-empty end-of-stream buffers, to fix gapless playback of streams
    with encoder padding when the decoder returns a non-empty final buffer.
  * Allow trimming more than one sample when applying an elst audio edit via
    gapless playback info.
  * Allow overriding skipping/scaling with custom `AudioProcessor`s
    ([#3142](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3142)).

    ([#3691](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3691)).
  * Expose ad load errors via `MediaSourceEventListener` on `AdsMediaSource`,
    and allow setting an ad event listener on `ImaAdsLoader`. Deprecate the
    `AdsMediaSource.EventListener`.
* Add `AnalyticsListener` interface which can be registered in
  `SimpleExoPlayer` to receive detailed metadata for each ExoPlayer event.
* Optimize seeking in FMP4 by enabling seeking to the nearest sync sample within
  a fragment. This benefits standalone FMP4 playbacks, DASH and SmoothStreaming.
* Updated default max buffer length in `DefaultLoadControl`.
* Fix ClearKey decryption error if the key contains a forward slash
  ([#4075](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/4075)).

* Support ZLIB compressed PGS subtitles.
* Added `getPlaybackError` to `Player` interface.
* Moved initial bitrate estimate from `AdaptiveTrackSelection` to
  `DefaultBandwidthMeter`.
* Removed default renderer time offset of 60000000 from internal player. The
  actual renderer timestamp offset can be obtained by listening to
  `BaseRenderer.onStreamChanged`.
* Added dependencies on checkerframework annotations for static code analysis.

### 2.7.3 ###

* Fix ProGuard configuration for Cast, IMA and OkHttp extensions.
* Update OkHttp extension to depend on OkHttp 3.10.0.

### 2.7.2 ###

* Gradle: Upgrade Gradle version from 4.1 to 4.4 so it can work with Android
  Studio 3.1 ([#3708](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3708)).
* Match codecs starting with "mp4a" to different Audio MimeTypes
  ([#3779](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3779)).
* Fix ANR issue on Redmi 4X and Redmi Note 4
  ([#4006](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/4006)).

  ([#4010](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/4010)).
* Fix "Decoder input buffer too small" error when playing some FLAC streams.
* MediaSession extension: Omit fast forward and rewind actions when media is not
  seekable ([#4001](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/4001)).

### 2.7.1 ###

* Gradle: Replaced 'compile' (deprecated) with 'implementation' and
  'api'. This may lead to build breakage for applications upgrading from
  previous version that rely on indirect dependencies of certain modules. In
  such cases, application developers need to add the missing dependency to
  their gradle file. You can read more about the new dependency configurations
  [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/gradle-plugin-3-0-0-migration.html#new_configurations).
* HlsMediaSource: Make HLS periods start at zero instead of the epoch.
  Applications that rely on HLS timelines having a period starting at
  the epoch will need to update their handling of HLS timelines. The program
  date time is still available via the informational
  `Timeline.Window.windowStartTimeMs` field
  ([#3865](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3865),
  [#3888](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3888)).
* Enable seeking in MP4 streams where duration is set incorrectly in the track
  header ([#3926](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3926)).
* Video: Force rendering a frame periodically in `MediaCodecVideoRenderer` and
  `LibvpxVideoRenderer`, even if it is late.

### 2.7.0 ###

* Player interface:
  * Add optional parameter to `stop` to reset the player when stopping.
  * Add a reason to `EventListener.onTimelineChanged` to distinguish between
    initial preparation, reset and dynamic updates.
  * Add `Player.DISCONTINUITY_REASON_AD_INSERTION` to the possible reasons
    reported in `Eventlistener.onPositionDiscontinuity` to distinguish
    transitions to and from ads within one period from transitions between
    periods.
  * Replaced `ExoPlayer.sendMessages` with `ExoPlayer.createMessage` to allow
    more customization of the message. Now supports setting a message delivery
    playback position and/or a delivery handler
    ([#2189](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/2189)).
  * Add `Player.VideoComponent`, `Player.TextComponent` and
    `Player.MetadataComponent` interfaces that define optional video, text and
    metadata output functionality. New `getVideoComponent`, `getTextComponent`
    and `getMetadataComponent` methods provide access to this functionality.
* Add `ExoPlayer.setSeekParameters` for controlling how seek operations are
  performed. The `SeekParameters` class contains defaults for exact seeking and
  seeking to the closest sync points before, either side or after specified seek
  positions. `SeekParameters` are not currently supported when playing HLS
  streams.
* DefaultTrackSelector:
  * Replace `DefaultTrackSelector.Parameters` copy methods with a builder.
  * Support disabling of individual text track selection flags.
* Buffering:
  * Allow a back-buffer of media to be retained behind the current playback
    position, for fast backward seeking. The back-buffer can be configured by
    custom `LoadControl` implementations.
  * Add ability for `SequenceableLoader` to re-evaluate its buffer and discard
    buffered media so that it can be re-buffered in a different quality.
  * Allow more flexible loading strategy when playing media containing multiple
    sub-streams, by allowing injection of custom `CompositeSequenceableLoader`
    factories through `DashMediaSource.Factory`, `HlsMediaSource.Factory`,
    `SsMediaSource.Factory`, and `MergingMediaSource`.
  * Play out existing buffer before retrying for progressive live streams
    ([#1606](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/1606)).
* UI components:
  * Generalized player and control views to allow them to bind with any
    `Player`, and renamed them to `PlayerView` and `PlayerControlView`
    respectively.
  * Made `PlayerView` automatically apply video rotation when configured to use
    `TextureView` ([#91](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/91)).
  * Made `PlayerView` play button behave correctly when the player is ended
    ([#3689](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3689)), and call a
    `PlaybackPreparer` when the player is idle.
* DRM: Optimistically attempt playback of DRM protected content that does not
  declare scheme specific init data in the manifest. If playback of clear
  samples without keys is allowed, delay DRM session error propagation until
  keys are actually needed
  ([#3630](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3630)).
* DASH:
  * Support in-band Emsg events targeting the player with scheme id
    `urn:mpeg:dash:event:2012` and scheme values "1", "2" and "3".
  * Support EventStream elements in DASH manifests.
* HLS:
    * Add opt-in support for chunkless preparation in HLS. This allows an
      HLS source to finish preparation without downloading any chunks, which can
      significantly reduce initial buffering time
      ([#3149](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3149)). More details
      can be found
      [here](https://medium.com/google-exoplayer/faster-hls-preparation-f6611aa15ea6).
    * Fail if unable to sync with the Transport Stream, rather than entering
      stuck in an indefinite buffering state.
    * Fix mime type propagation
      ([#3653](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3653)).
    * Fix ID3 context reuse across segment format changes
      ([#3622](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3622)).
    * Use long for media sequence numbers
      ([#3747](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3747))
    * Add initial support for the EXT-X-GAP tag.

  * Support TrueHD passthrough for rechunked samples in Matroska files
    ([#2147](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/2147)).
  * Support resampling 24-bit and 32-bit integer to 32-bit float for high
    resolution output in `DefaultAudioSink`
    ([#3635](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/pull/3635)).

    presentation timestamp
    ([#3782](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3782)).
* Caching:
  * Fix cache corruption issue
    ([#3762](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3762)).

      ([#3552](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3552)).
    * Handle asset mismatch errors
      ([#3801](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3801)).
    * Add support for playing non-Extractor content MediaSources in
      the IMA demo app
      ([#3676](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3676)).
    * Fix handling of ad tags where ad groups are out of order
      ([#3716](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3716)).
    * Fix handling of ad tags with only preroll/postroll ad groups
      ([#3715](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3715)).
    * Propagate ad media preparation errors to IMA so that the ads can be
      skipped.

### r2.0.0 ###

ExoPlayer 2.x is a major iteration of the library. It includes significant API
and architectural changes, new features and many bug fixes. You can read about
some of the motivations behind ExoPlayer 2.x
[here](https://medium.com/google-exoplayer/exoplayer-2-x-why-what-and-when-74fd9cb139#.am7h8nytm).

* Root package name changed to `com.google.android.exoplayer2`. The library
  structure and class names have also been sanitized. Read more
  [here](https://medium.com/google-exoplayer/exoplayer-2-x-new-package-and-class-names-ef8e1d9ba96f#.lv8sd4nez).
* Key architectural changes:
  * Late binding between rendering and media source components. Allows the same
    rendering components to be re-used from one playback to another. Enables
    features such as gapless playback through playlists and DASH multi-period
    support.
  * Improved track selection design. More details can be found
    [here](https://medium.com/google-exoplayer/exoplayer-2-x-track-selection-2b62ff712cc9#.n00zo76b6).
  * LoadControl now used to control buffering and loading across all playback
    types.
  * Media source components given additional structure. A new MediaSource class
    has been introduced. MediaSources expose Timelines that describe the media
    they expose, and can consist of multiple MediaPeriods. This enables features
    such as seeking in live playbacks and DASH multi-period support.
  * Responsibility for loading the initial DASH/SmoothStreaming/HLS manifest is
    promoted to the corresponding MediaSource components and is no longer the
    application's responsibility.
  * Higher level abstractions such as SimpleExoPlayer have been added to the
    library. These make the library easier to use for common use cases. The demo
    app is halved in size as a result, whilst at the same time gaining more
    functionality. Read more
    [here](https://medium.com/google-exoplayer/exoplayer-2-x-improved-demo-app-d97171aaaaa1).
  * Enhanced library support for implementing audio extensions. Read more
    [here](https://medium.com/google-exoplayer/exoplayer-2-x-new-audio-features-cfb26c2883a#.ua75vu4s3).
  * Format and MediaFormat are replaced by a single Format class.
* Key new features:
  * Playlist support. Includes support for gapless playback between playlist
    items and consistent application of LoadControl and TrackSelector policies
    when transitioning between items
    ([#1270](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/1270)).
  * Seeking in live playbacks for DASH and SmoothStreaming
    ([#291](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/291)).
  * DASH multi-period support
    ([#557](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/557)).
  * MediaSource composition allows MediaSources to be concatenated into a
    playlist, merged and looped. Read more
    [here](https://medium.com/google-exoplayer/exoplayer-2-x-mediasource-composition-6c285fcbca1f#.zfha8qupz).
  * Looping support (see above)
    ([#490](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/490)).
  * Ability to query information about all tracks in a piece of media (including
    those not supported by the device)
    ([#1121](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/1121)).
  * Improved player controls.
  * Support for PSSH in fMP4 moof atoms
    ([#1143](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/1143)).
  * Support for Opus in Ogg
    ([#1447](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/1447)).
  * CacheDataSource support for standalone media file playbacks (mp3, mp4 etc).
  * FFMPEG extension (for audio only).
* Key bug fixes:
  * Removed unnecessary secondary requests when playing standalone media files
    ([#1041](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/1041)).
  * Fixed playback of video only (i.e. no audio) live streams
    ([#758](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/758)).
  * Fixed silent failure when media buffer is too small
    ([#583](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/583)).
  * Suppressed "Sending message to a Handler on a dead thread" warnings
    ([#426](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/426)).

# Legacy release notes #

Note: Since ExoPlayer V1 is still being maintained alongside V2, there is some
overlap between these notes and the notes above. r2.0.0 followed from r1.5.11,
