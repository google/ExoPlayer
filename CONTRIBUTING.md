# How to Contribute #

We'd love to hear your feedback. Please open new issues describing any bugs,
feature requests or suggestions that you have.

We will also consider high quality pull requests. These should normally merge
into the [dev][] branch rather than master. To contribute in this way you must
first submit a Contributor License Agreement, as described below.

## Contributor License Agreement ##

Contributions to any Google project must be accompanied by a Contributor
License Agreement.  This is not a copyright **assignment**, it simply gives
Google permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the
project.

  * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you
    own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual
    CLA][].

  * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,
    then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA][].

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted
one (even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.
